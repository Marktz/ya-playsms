TODO:

    - overhaul pattern-matching for 'features' (autoreply, polls, etc)
        - allow for multiple patterns to go to one feature (e.g., keyword variations)

    inbox/outbox:
        - preserve returns in inbox/outbox
        - incoming/outgoing log output as csv
        - add visual graphing of incoming / outgoing autoreplies

    kannel:
        - fix kannel's geturl to not hit the database on load (possible?)
        - have kannel's confs setup for multiple smsc modems? how to test? how are they routed?

    - start overhauling php database code to use formbuilder
    - automated suoders on install/uninstall (visudo)
    - get referrer info for easy "go back"

DONE:
