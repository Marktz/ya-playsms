TODO:

	- have autosend do groups, phonebook names, as well as numbers

    inbox/outbox:
		- export date histogram
        - add visual graphing of incoming / outgoing autoreplies

	- new feature: subscriptions

	- can get rid of playsms url?

    kannel:
        - fix kannel's geturl to not hit the database on load (possible?)
        - have kannel's confs setup for multiple smsc modems? how to test? how are they routed?

    - start overhauling php database code to use formbuilder
    - automated suoders on install/uninstall (visudo)
    - get referrer info for easy "go back"

DONE:

	- import/export config file of keywords/replies

	- interesting mis-texts:
		pill #1
		stds # 7
		condom2
		hivaids_6
		genfacts 7.

		info stds
		set pill
		c0nd0m 2 
		genfact 8
		ex: set
		preg,

		set genfacts, c0nd0m
		pill 1 5 7 9
		iud 1,2,3,4

	- lenient keyword matching:
		- concat keywords from db using more than just space: no-space, pound, pound-space, underscore
		- if no immediate match, match with sql like and %
		- have top-level 'alias' checkbox to point to other top-level keyword (eg, genfact -> genfacts)
		- have special syntax for scenario results to point to other scenarios
			- eg, for 'set pill' it would be '##pill##'
			- have param variables?

    - overhaul pattern-matching for 'features' (autoreply, polls, etc)
        - allow for multiple patterns to go to one feature (e.g., keyword variations)


- preserve returns in inbox/outbox
- incoming/outgoing log output as csv

- easy database upgrading
- resending
- resend link for outbox to automate resending


- sync svn with google code
- display better logs (show all incoming and all outgoing, not just by user)
- adduser (remove user from groups?)

- POST with javascript?
- handle incoming balance check (broadcast to admin group)
- move svn over to ubuntu side
- download pear database / quickform packages
- fix deleting autoreplies and autoreply_scenarios
- change package to be able to overwrite kannel's conf (using Replaces?)
- allow for renaming autoreply codes
- add cron feature
- how to determine platform from php
